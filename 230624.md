### String

#### Slices

- it slices from start index up to end index (which means it does not include the last item)
- if the end index does not exist, then the string goes as much as it can
- there is a brief syntax which does not include either start index or the last index
- there is a third optional value : `step`

```py
# intro[startIdx:endIdx]

intro='this is kim'
intro[0:4] # this
intro[0:99] # this is kim

# intro[0:4] is same as
intro[:4]

# iintro[8:11] is same as
intro[8:]

# from index 0 upto 11 every 2 steps
intro[0:11:2] # 'ti skm'
```

#### Escape Characters

- for the single, double quote, it is easier to mix single and double quote together.

```py
# example

newline = 'hello\nworld'
tab = 'hello\tworld'
single_quote = 'kim\'s world'
double_quote = "kim said, \"hello!\""
back_slash = 'hey\\^^/'

```

#### Triple Quotes

- can use with both single and double
- this is useful when using multiple lines

```py
'''
hello
single
quote
'''

"""
hello
double
quote
"""
```
